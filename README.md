gighuntr.github.com
===================

A tool for finding freelance gigs by searching various job boards using a custom Google search.

# Search URLs

GigHuntr uses a Google Custom Search to provide results from many different job boards.

URLs are added to the Custom Search using the advanced mode at this address: http://www.google.com/cse/panel/sites?cx={partner-pub-ID}

Any URLs added must be included in the Google Search index already, or they will not appear in Custom Search results.

See the lists below of examples of the URLs being used, and those which are not being used.
